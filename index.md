## About Me

I'm Dr. Becky Seifried, the GIS Librarian at UMass Amherst. Check out our [GIS website](https://gis.library.umass.edu/) to learn more about the cool programs and resources on campus. Or check out my [Academia profile](https://umass.academia.edu/RebeccaSeifried) to learn more about my research.

Lots of the data featured here comes from a lovely part of the world called the **Mani peninsula**, which sits at the southernmost part of the Greek mainland. If you'd like to learn more about the research that my colleages and I are doing in Mani, check out some of these links:
