# About Me

I'm Dr. Becky Seifried, the GIS Librarian at UMass Amherst. Check out our [GIS website](https://gis.library.umass.edu/) to learn more about the cool geospatial programs and resources on campus. 

Lots of the data featured here comes from a lovely part of the world called the **Mani peninsula**, which sits at the southernmost part of the Greek mainland. To learn more about the area, hop to the bottom of the page for extra links.

# WebGIS Portfolio, May 2020

All of these projects were crafted with love for a class on **WebGIS**, which I had the pleasure of taking with Dr. Forrest Bowlick at UMass Amherst. Highly recommended!
